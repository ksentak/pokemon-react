# Pokegame React App

---

### Description
A simple react application I created when I was first learning React that demonstrates my knowledge of using props and components. Once the page is loaded, the user is presented with 4 Pokemon on each team. The team with the greater total experience points is deemed the winner the other other team is marked as the loser. The user can refresh the page to alter the teams/result.
